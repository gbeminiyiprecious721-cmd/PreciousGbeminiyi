# US Medical Insurance Cost Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This is my first data science project, where I am currently working on analyzing **US medical insurance cost data**. 
The goal of this project is to explore how different factors influence medical insurance charges and to gain hands-on experience with data analysis and modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the structure of the dataset
* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Explore relationships between features and insurance costs
* Gain practical experience in data analysis and basic modeling

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes information such as:

* Age
* Sex
* Body Mass Index (BMI)
* Number of children
* Smoking status
* Region
* Insurance charges

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature analysis and visualization
5. (Upcoming) Model building and evaluation

## 🚧 Project Status

🔧 **In Progress** — currently working on data exploration and analysis.

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

* Insights into key factors affecting medical insurance costs
* Visualizations showing data trends and patterns
* A foundation for applying machine learning models

## 🤝 Future Improvements

* Apply regression models to predict insurance costs
* Improve feature engineering
* Add model evaluation and performance metrics
